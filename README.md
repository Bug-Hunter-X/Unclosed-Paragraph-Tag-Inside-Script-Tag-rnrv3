# Unclosed Paragraph Tag Inside Script Tag

This example demonstrates an uncommon HTML error where an unclosed paragraph tag (<p>) is placed inside a <script> tag. This is invalid HTML and can lead to unexpected behavior or parsing errors in some browsers.  The solution involves removing the paragraph tag from the script section.
